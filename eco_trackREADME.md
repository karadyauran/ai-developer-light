# EcoTrack

Welcome to EcoTrack, an innovative project that nurtures an environmentally conscious society. Our solution provides a concrete way to track and quantify carbon footprints, generated during our daily activities.

Commuting to work, munching on a packed lunch, even scrolling on your devices - all these have a carbon cost. By making these costs transparent and tangible, we can make informed choices, drive change, and work towards greener alternatives!

Our inspiration draws from the global awakening to the urgent need for sustainability. The dire state of our planet, due to years of reckless abuse, demands immediate advocacy and action. Every bit of conscious effort counts and it's high time we pay heed!

EcoTrack is an endeavor to facilitate and accelerate this process. This application software, generated by OpenAI's impressive chat-gpt API, provides real-time data about an individual's carbon footprint, based on daily inputs via API endpoints.

Join us in our mission to create a future where progress is in harmony with the planet. Because every step back for carbon, is a leap forward for Earth!

Let's rewrite the tale of our planet. One carbon footprint at a time.
