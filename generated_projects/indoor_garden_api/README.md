# 🌱 Indoor Garden API 🌷

At the heart of every concrete jungle, there is a need for that touch of green to bring life into our urban landscapes. This has led to the rise of indoor gardening amongst city dwellers 🏙️, but the shift from outdoor to indoor poses a new set of challenges 🌵 

This is why we've launched the Indoor Garden API 🌿, an application designed to bridge those gaps and aid urban gardeners in their green endeavors. We are fueled by the shared love for houseplants and driven by our motivation to simplify indoor gardening for everyone, regardless of their experience level 🌸 

The Indoor Garden API provides users with relevant, location-specific information on the ins-and-outs of indoor gardening. From advice on suitable plants based on light, temperature, and space constraints 🌳, to tracking watering schedules 🌧️ and offering solutions for common plant diseases. It's all there at your fingertips! 🍃 

And, to ice our botanical cake, we are proud to say that this application was born out of a collaboration with chat-gpt's API, who generated the code behind our growth. Together, we're not just sowing seeds but paving the way for the next generation of indoor gardeners. 🎍 

So keep those thumbs green, and don't let those potted dreams just be dreams. Happy indoor gardening! 🍀
