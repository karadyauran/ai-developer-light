# 🚀 AI Dev Developer

**AI Dev Developer** is an innovative tool designed to help startups and non-technical individuals quickly generate full backend web application projects in Go using the Gin framework. Whether you're looking to test out new ideas or quickly prototype an app, AI Dev Developer brings your concepts to life by building the backend for you in a monolithic structure.

## ✨ Why AI Dev Developer?

The idea behind this project was born out of a need to keep my GitHub activity streak going—what started as a small Python script has now evolved into a powerful tool that can help anyone test and visualize their web application ideas quickly. Now rewritten in Go with a focus on clean architecture, AI Dev Developer empowers users by automating the process of creating project skeletons, so they can focus on refining their ideas rather than writing code from scratch.

## 🎯 How It Works

The app generates a random project idea and builds out the backend for you, complete with Docker files, databases, and necessary configurations like `package.json`. **Frontend functionality is in development and will be released in future updates**.

- Full backend generation in Go
- Monolithic structure
- Docker compatibility for easy deployment
- Project generation based on your custom prompts

Simply write your own prompts, and let AI Dev Developer handle the backend creation!

## 🛠️ Future Plans

We are continuously improving AI Dev Developer to add more features like:

- 🖥️ Web interface for easy idea submission
- 🗂️ Separate repositories for each generated project
- 🏗️ Docker workers for parallel project creation
- 🔄 Working on existing projects instead of starting new ones
- 🌍 Frontend integration and deployment to a server for file generation
